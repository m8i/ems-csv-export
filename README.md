Output events for a specific building in CSV format from the EMS API

EMS is from Dean Evans and Associates (dea.com). 

I am not affiliated with EMS. I am a user of EMS.

I needed a way to quickly incorporate event data into digital signage, and this was my solution.

You'll need to be an EMS customer and have the EMS API installed and running on your EMS Web server. After that, there's a few quick config variables in the script, then you're off to the races.

Just point your signage player to consume the CSV, and let it parse the data out.
